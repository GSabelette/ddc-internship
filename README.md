# ddc-internship
Work produced during my internship working on the DDC library : https://github.com/Maison-de-la-Simulation/ddc

global_variables folder regroups work used to deepcopy user objects between CPU and GPU and access them as global variables accross different GPU kernels.

kokkos_game_of_life folder regroups work used to benchmark implementations of Conway's game of life using Kokkos (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos).

Rest is mostly deprecated/rubbish that's kept here for posterity/reminding me of a couple of terrible ideas so I don't repeat the same mistakes.
